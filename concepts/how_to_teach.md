Job of teaching it to build a mental model into which facts are slotted.

Concept maps are a form of externalized cognition

Expertise is determined not by facts installed, but by richness of interconnectedness in the mental model

During learning, new items are loaded into short term memory, and gradually rehearsed and transferred into long-term memory.

Single teaching sssion should hold only 7+/-2 concepts

Strategies:
1. Spaced practice : 10 hrs over five days better than one 10 hr day
2. Retrieval practice : use tests to force retrieval; solve problems twice; flash cards
3. Interleave : different topics
4. elaboration : talk to yourself
5. concrete examples : give analogy, draw diagram, give example, describe idea, then give technical details
6. dual coding : combine words & images
