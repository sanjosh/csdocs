# Distinguishing Noise Sources with Information Theory

Mutual information provides a promising method for disentangling intrinsic from extrinsic sources of noise in biological systems.

 Nicoletti and Busiello address this issue by using mutual information theory, which quantifies the level of independence of two variables, to untangle internal and environmental correlations from a signal.

 derived the joint probability distribution of the particles’ positions in the asymptotic limit that the temperature patches were large (slow temperature switching). Then they calculated the mutual information between the two particles, finding that it is exactly the Shannon entropy of the fluctuating environment. (In the asymptotic limit of small patches—quick temperature switching—the particles were independent and thus contained no environmental contribution to their mutual information.) Nicoletti and Busiello then repeated the calculations for two spring-coupled particles, finding that the mutual information between them is the superposition of the environmental mutual information for two uncoupled particles and that of the mutual information for interactions intrinsic to two coupled particles. Thus, they were able to separate intrinsic and extrinsic effects.
