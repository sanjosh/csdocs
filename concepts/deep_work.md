Deliberate practice requires clear performance goal and immediate informative feedback

Strategies

## Work deeply 

### decide your depth philosophy 

monastic, bimodal, rhythmic, journalistic

### ritualize

Be regular and orderly in your life, so you can be violent and original in your work

think like artists, work like accountants

### execute like a business

1. focus on wildly important
2. act on lead measures (lead and lag metrics of 4DX method)
3. keep a compelling scoreboard
4. regular review

## Embrace boredom

take breaks from work, not distraction

set tight deadlines

focus on single problem


## Quit social media

## Drain the shallows

schedule everything

create budget for shallow work

cap your day

become hard to reach
