# examples

1. principle of least privilege : only give access to required building
2. defense in depth : multiple layers; check badge at entry + each building
3. minimize attack surface : keep few gates for entry; close others
4. security in the open : don't allow entry using some hidden tunnel
5. fail securely : on alarm, lock down all doors instead of opening them

renew trust : give time-bound access to resource

revoke authorization first, credentials second

policy is defined by logical not physical
