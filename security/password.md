# password expiration is dead

Outdated threat model 

Passwords that would have taken your average cyber attacker 90 days to crack twenty years ago now takes literal seconds, thanks to solutions like AWS.

If a password is never stolen, thereâ€™s no need to expire it. And if you have evidence that a password has been stolen, you would presumably act immediately rather than wait for expiration to fix the problem.

Instead use 
1. MFA 
2. banned-password lists 
3. detection of password-guessing attacks
4. detection of anomalous logon attempts
5. disable admin 
6. support the auto-generation of strong password
