It is also possible to read and modify the console loglevel using the text file /proc/sys/kernel/printk. The file hosts four integer values: 

the current loglevel, 
the default level for messages that lack an explicit loglevel, 
the minimum allowed loglevel, 
and the boot-time default loglevel. 

Writing a single value to this file changes the current loglevel to that value; thus, for example, you can cause all kernel messages to appear at the console by simply entering:
