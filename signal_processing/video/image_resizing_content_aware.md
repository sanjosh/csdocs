[The seam carving algorithm] changes the size of an image by gracefully 
carving out or inserting pixels in different parts of the image. Seam 
carving uses an energy function defining the importance of pixels. A seam 
is a connected path of low energy pixels crossing the image from top to 
bottom, or from left to right. By successively removing or inserting 
seams we can reduce, as well as enlarge, the size of an image in both 
directions. For image reduction, [â€¦] we remove more of the low energy 
pixels and fewer of the high energy ones.
