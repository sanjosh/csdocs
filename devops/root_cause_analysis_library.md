PyRCA primarily focuses on metric-based RCA, including two types of algorithms: (1) identifying anomalous metrics in parallel with the observed anomaly through metric data analysis, such as Îµ-diagnosis, and (2) identifying root causes based on a topology/causal graph representing the causal relationships between the observed metrics, such as Bayesian inference and Random Walk.
