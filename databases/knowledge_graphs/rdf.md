## RDFS

```
RDFS (RDF Schema) extends RDF with the most basic ontological constraints and semantics: 
class and property subtypes, along with property range and domain restrictions. 
These constructs allow for building very simple type hierarchies over RDF data, which 
are also represented within RDF graphs. Because of that simplicity, the effective reasoning 
mechanism over RDFS can be captured entirely by SPARQL (via property paths), 
thus not requiring additional, computationally expensive inference tools.
