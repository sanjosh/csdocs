OWL adds numerous ontological constructs on top of those introduced by RDFS. 
OWL ontologies can also be represented in RDF graphs, but to make any 
meaningful use of their intended semantics in the prototypical use-case scenarios, 
one needs specialised tools: reasoners (OWL DL, EL), rule engines (OWL RL), 
and query rewriting systems (OWL QL).
