# question answering

semantic parsing : converting a natural question into a formal KG query 

## neural approaches

prediction models commonly used in semantic parsing into three major categories
1. classification, 
2. ranking, 
3. translation.

Knowledge Graph data was formatted in Triples, i.e. every fact was represented by three pieces, 
1. subject (entity), 
2. predicate (relationship), 
3. object (another entity). 

Queries had to go from [S P] → [O], from [P O] → [S], and sometimes from [S O] → [P].
