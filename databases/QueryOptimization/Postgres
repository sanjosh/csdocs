RelOptInfo represents a base table
RelOptInfo.pathlist = paths made for a given relation (index scan, table scan).
RelOptInfo.joininfo


Join tree build using dynamic programming
First pass : joins with two items
second pass : joins with 3 items
etc

============

Generic Query Optimization (GEQO)

Join plans are developed using the genetic approach
Strng represents the join order from one relation to another.

========

Three core join algo : Nested loop, merge, hash join
Two aggregation algo : hash, sort
Two scan algo : index, sequential

Many equivalences in SQL
JOins can be applied in any order
predicates can be evaluated in any order
subselects can be transformed to joins
