Jit converts to native code before execution
interpreter may or may not

Runtime optimizations => JIT
global optimizations => Compiler
Optimize across ops => ?

sqlite emits bytecode
postgres, mongo has parse tree

parse -> bytecode -> JIT engine 
Ahead-of-time AOT techniques

JIT engines
1) llvm has 2 engines : JIT(old) and MCJIT(new) 
	(MC means machine code)
	llvm used in webkit ftl 
	what is kaleidoscope
2) libjit
3) gnu lightning
4) LUA

sqlite ops

=============

Questions:
1) how can we use JIT to optimize across threads (amortize)
2) what basic ops should offloader support

===========
