VITESS

WORKLOAD
- how much data per video and per user (static and dynamic)
- what is read-write ratio for youtube mysql ?
- number of distinct queries at youtube 
  - programmatic or human 
  - do analytical queries run on vitess as well?

MYSQL
- gtid based repl ?
- statement based or row-based
- innodb or rocksdb

PROXY
- would it have been simpler to modify mysql server
  instead of building vitess front-end

- why not modify mysql proxy instead of vtablet or vtgate
  (mariadb has its own proxy - maxscale)

- subscribes to its own mysql server for cache invalidation
  (fb annotated binlog to update memcache)

- why not use mysql features ?
  its possible to kill queries in slow log

SHARDING 
   - how to maintain foreign key constraints
   - joins
   - uneven distribution
   - UDFs 
   - does table need primary key ?

- replication lag for bulk ops 

- do u disable mysql buffer cache, given the row cache

- why is per conn cost 2 MB (cant u reduce buffers)

- vttablet query cache - why not use mysql query cache
 - do you also cache negative results ?

- mysql query cost (does vttablet use query optimizer)
 - does it keep per-user limits ?
