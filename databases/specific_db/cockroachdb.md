# CockroachDB (like Spanner)

## Partitioning

* range = 64MB in size
* persisted locally in rocksdb
* rebalancing algo
* have raft group per range

A crucial enhancement to the organization of range metadata is to augment the bi-level range metadata lookup with a minimum spanning tree,   
implemented as a left-leaning red-black tree over all ranges in the map. This tree structure allows the system to start at any key prefix   
and efficiently traverse an arbitrary key range with minimal RPC traffic, minimal fan-in and fan-out, and   
with bounded time complexity equal to 2 * log2N steps, where N is the total number of ranges in the system.

## Index

* Secondary index - each index has indexID
* add primary Key to allow storing non-unique index in key-value store
* stored as <tableId/indexID/indexValue/primaryKey> => columnVal

## locks

1. unreplicated
1. replicated : intent locks

Cockroach provides distributed transactions without locks. Cockroach transactions support two isolation levels: 
1. snapshot isolation (SI) 
2. serializable snapshot isolation (SSI).

## Storage

* How table is mapped to kv store
* used like columnar store but sorted by key instead of position
* each table has tableID; this is prefixed to every key
* each column has columnID
* each column is stored as <tableId, primaryKey, columnID> => columnVal
* not necessary to store rows for columns which are already part of primary key
* all keys for same row stored next to each other because of columnId suffix
* NULL column values not stored
* if all columns NULL, store sentinel
