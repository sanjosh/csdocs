DONE 1) ensure all imm are unref
  JobContext::superversions_to_free
            ::memtables_to_free

2) Must delete only those Imm
 with imm->lastSeqNum < offloader.seqNum

 we want to run just enuf of flushJob so it
 extracts which imm to flush
 but we dont want to flush any imm
 we just want to unref them
 so that the cleanup will delete those imm

  FlushJob::Run()
  {
    FlushJob::WriteLevel0Table
    BuildTable
    {
      use CompactionIterator to write to TableBuilder
    }
  }

DONE 2) Send back last wal sequence number 
 from offloader so that imm only before that
 number are truncated 

DONE 3) change iter and Get so that it first look up imm

5) normal iter will ignore overlap key on offloader
  since it will find the latest key in imm

   but how will tailing iter work
   it only uses 
  should LookupKey sent to offloader change ?

6) How to ensure same key not returned twice
  RemoteIter must be part of VersionSet on client
  RemoteIter must get sequence number before imm earliest

  if data is ordered by seqno
    --- earlier        -- later ----
  ======REMOTE === | ========LOCAL =========

  remote has all < imm->first_seqno (or earliest_seqno)
  local has all data >= imm->first_seqno
