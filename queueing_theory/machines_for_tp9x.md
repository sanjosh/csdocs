how many servers needed at tp99 as opposed to tp95

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/702121/m-m-3-queue-reducing-wait-time-by-adding-servers

Can I complete all burst requests before next burst ?

If (moderate latency) and (time between 2 bursts is large) 
	use TP 90 response time 
Else
	use TP 99 response time

In (M/M/c/K), calculate Response Time for various values of “c”
