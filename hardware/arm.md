Key Takeaways
1. Arm-based systems and instances are readily available in public clouds such as AWS.
1. The computational performance of AWS’s Arm EC2 instances is similar to that of the x86_64 instances.
1. Considering that Arm instances are significantly cheaper, the cost effectiveness of Arm instances are better than x86_64 instances.
1. Arm instances perform better with “close to metal” applications. We hypothesize that the operating systems have received more engineering efforts to optimize for Arm than high level application frameworks.
1. WebAssembly VMs outperform Docker and Node.js significantly for computational applications.
