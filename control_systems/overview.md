The Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma connects two areas of control theory:
frequency methods and time-domain algebraic methods.

PID controller vs PI controller: Achieve asymptotic regulation in
presence of parameter uncertainties.

| Dimension | description |
------------------------
| SISO vs MIMO |  |
| Discrete vs continuous |  |
| Adaptive control | Parametrizes uncertainty in terms of certain unknown parameters. Uses feedback to learn these parameters online. |
| Fuzzy control |  |
| Stochastic control | |
| Intelligent control | Uses AI techniques. |
| Linear vs nonlinear |  |
| Robust control  | The problem of designing controllers that satisfy both the robust stability and some performance criteria is called robust control.  Controllers designed using robust control methods tend to be able to cope with small differences between the true system and the nominal model used for design. |
Uncertainty is modeled as perturbation of nominal model.  Design tries to meet objective for any model in ball of uncertainty.
| Optimal control | Based on calculus of variations. |
| Hâˆž control theory | Optimization method.  H stands for Hardy space.  One of the cornerstones of modern control theory. It was developed to solve such problems with very strong practical implications. The widely accepted modern technique for solving robust control problems now is to reduce them to linear matrix inequalities problems (LMI). |
| Fractional order control |  |
