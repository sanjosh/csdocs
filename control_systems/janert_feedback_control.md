Goal is control, not optimization

* Setpoint = desired value
* tracking error = setpoint - output
* controller gain = how much to multiply the tracking error

goals
* stability
* responsiveness
* accuracy

sampling rate must be greater than change rate of signal

response = steady state + transient

lags and delay cause oscillations

dead zone and hysterisis reduce changes in control

Proportional droop
