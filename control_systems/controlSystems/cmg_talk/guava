==============
Guava Rate Limiter 
  - has warmup period

rate at which stored permits are given out

** it remembers expected time of next request, rather than time of last request

increase stored permit if req arrives later than expected

function storedPermitsToWaitTime() calculates
  how soon to expend stored permits
this time is added to NextFreeTicketMicros

let request exceeding permit start right away; delay next request

======

Guava Rate Limiter
has two - SmoothBursty and SmoothWarmingUp

fairness - NO
Bursts - YES
warmup - YES
stored permits - upto maxPermits
dynamically alter rate ?

has no queue unlike rocksdb - just a mutex

explain storedPermitsToWaitTime()

acquire(permits)
{
  take mutex
  time = reserveEarliestAvailable(permits)
  sleep(time
}
