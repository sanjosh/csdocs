uses timer and FSM and queue
----------------
Reactive streams is SPI can be implemented by any libraries

Mandates back-pressure signaling is async
even if actual data processing is not

Subscriber sends back-pressure signal to quantify congestion

Reactive Streams are 
push­based when the Subscriber is faster, 
pull­based when the Publisher is faster."
