ClientQuotaManager.scala

Client byte rate is measured over multiple small windows (for e.g. 30 windows of
1 second each) in order to detect and correct quota violations quickly.
Typically, having large measurement windows (for e.g. 10 windows of 30 seconds
each) leads to large bursts of traffic followed by long delays which is not
great in terms of user experience.
