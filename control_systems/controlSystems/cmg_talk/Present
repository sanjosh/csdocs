Lot of effort write logic - few focus on adaptive to load

Limiters in Big Data systems

Sender Side throttle or Receiver side backpressure

Congestion control
 Open Loop  - Leaky bucket, token bucket
 Closed Loop - 

Kafka - 
WDT - 
RocksDB -
Guava - Slow start
Spark - PID

Problem
* multiple threads calling a func

acquire(bytes)
{
  decide sleep time based on bytes
}

Desiderata
* long term stead rate
* short term bursts overutilization - allow bursts
* underutilization - warmup period
* priority - fairness
* dynamically alter rate

Impl
* remember time of last request OR
* remember time of next expected request (Guava)
