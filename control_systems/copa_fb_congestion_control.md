We implemented and evaluated COPA, which is a tunable delay-based congestion control algorithm designed at MIT. COPA is based on an objective function where the trade-off between throughput and delay can be configured via a user-specified parameter, delta. A higher value of delta makes COPA more sensitive to delays and provides lower throughput. A lower value of delta will provide more goodput at the cost of incurring more delays.
