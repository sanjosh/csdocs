# Babcock, Chain scheduling for queries in data stream systems

processing bursty streams â€” adaptive, load-aware scheduling of query operators
to minimize resource consumption during times of peak load

Chain scheduling, a near-optimal scheduling strategy for the case when
all queries involve a single stream, possibly joining with stored relations via foreign-key joins
