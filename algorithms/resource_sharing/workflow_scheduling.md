# Concepts

Goals

1. admission control
1. capacity allocation
1. load balancing
1. QoS
1. energy optimization

## solution space

1. control theory : optimal control, model predictive control
2. optimization : kkt conditions, pareto
3. scheduling 

## List scheduling

see wikipedia

## Makespan

finding a map between tasks and resources in order to meet the QoS parameters defined for each job.

## Two-level resource allocation architecture

Workflows are an application model that enables the automated execution of multiple interdependent and
interconnected tasks.
