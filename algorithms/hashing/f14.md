# F14 fb

1. Do you keep long-lived references or pointers to the entries?
2. Do you care more about CPU or memory?
3. How big are your keys?  Are the keys strings?
4. How big are your tables?
5. What is the operation mix between insertions, searches, and iteration?  How often do you erase?

### Features

* map keys to a chunk (a block of slots) instead of to a single slot, 
* search within the chunk in parallel using vector instructions (SSE2 or NEON) 
* F14 since it filters 14 slots at once (this chunk size is a good trade-off between cache alignment and collision rate).
* The lower bits of the full hash code determine the chunk. The upper bits are used to filter which slots in a chunk might hold the search key.


## where to stop search using probing if keys are being deleted ?

* For deletion, use reference-counted tombstones.
* set bit on bucket slot when insert goes past slot that is full
* search stops at a full slot whose overflow bit is clear, even if the following slot is not empty.
