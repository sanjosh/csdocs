# Randomized algorithms Motwani

randomized = input agnostic

randomized algo = distribution over set of deterministic algo

output always correct = las vegas; not correct = monte carlo

linearity of expectation

optimization problem => decision problem => language recognition problem (membership of string in lang)

P = can be found & verified
NP = can be verified

lower bound of randomized algo found using minimax principle (2.2)

randomization useful : uniform vs non-uniform

occupancy problem - coupon collector

variance of sum = sum of variance

martingale : E[Xk] = E[X0]

two-point sampling

## bounds on tail : 

markov inequality, 

chebyshev

chernoff bound
