string distance algo

Hamming distance : Number of positions with same symbol in both strings.  Only defined for strings of equal length.

Levenshtein : Minimal number of insertions, deletions and replacements needed for transforming string a into string b.

Damerau-levenshtein : transposition of adjacent symbols allowed

Restricted Damerau-Levenshtein : Like (full) Damerau-Levenshtein distance but each substring may only be edited once.

Longest common substring : Minimum number of symbols that have to be removed in both strings until resulting substrings are identical.

q-gram distance : Sum of absolute differences between N-gram vectors of both strings.

Cosine distance : 1 - cosine similarity between N-gram vectors

Jaccard distance : 1 - quotient of shared N-grams and all observed N-grams

Jaro distance : special case of jaro-winkler distance with p=0

Jaro-winkler distance :
