modules : threading, contextmanager(for deadlock avoidance), concurrent.futures

Since Only one thread in Python interpreter at a time, 
1) use threads for IO handler 
2) move comp. intensive code to C module : ctypes releases GIL before entering C code
3) Use PyPy JIT compiler
4) Use multiprocessing module to create process pool - ProcessPoolExecutor : runs comp intensive func in separate instance of Python interpreter

Either use Thread() class to start thread  - better bcos code can be run indep of thread
OR 
Derive from Thread class

ThreadPoolExecutor

Generators (green threads) as alternative to Threads
Actor model
