# exceptions talk

use repr(e) instead of str(e)

logging.error (“ %r”, e)

else exists ! try except else finally

Do not raise another Exception inside except - do it on next line

raise Exception from e

raise Exception from None - this is better to hide internal exceptions

NotImplemented not same as NotImplementederror

Exception Hierarchy -

exception.args attribute

“__traceback__”
