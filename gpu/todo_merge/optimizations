Mapped transfer better than serial or streaming 

------------
streams & async

"Based on our tests it appears the streaming API schedules asynchronous
tasks based on when they were added to the streams, rather
than checking at runtime which streams are ready to run
considering current memory transfers." (Virginian Data Management paper)

zip_iterator in thrust

structure of arrays (mem coalescing)
instead of 
vector<A> where struct A
{
    float x;
    float y;
} 
we do 
struct StructOfFloats
{
    device_vector<float> x;
    device_vector<float> y;
}
