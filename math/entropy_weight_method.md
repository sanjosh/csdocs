## multi-attribute decision making 

how to decide weights  ?

1. normalize the decision matrix (divide each number by sum)
2. calculate entropy of each attribute [h = - logn(number of choices)]
3. degree of diversification = 1 - entropy
4. compute weight vector
5. these can decide weight of each attribute

```
When the difference of two alternatives about the j-th attribute is small, then this attribute does not provide sufficient information to rank or distinguish the two alternatives. 
Therefore, the less is the difference, the smaller is the weight.
