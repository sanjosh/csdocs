find if rectangle can be inscribed on arbitrary closed loop

## map to 3D surface

Create function f(p1, p2) = x, y, z    
where z = distance(p1, p2)

this creates a 3D surface 

on this surface, you have to show this function has a collision : two pairs map to same point in 3D space

## map ordered pairs to cylinder

map closed loop to a straight line

cut in curve map to two points (0 and 1)

create square above line to represent pair of points

and glue up square to create torus (donut) 

every individual point on torus => pair of points on closed loop

## map unordered pairs to mobius strip

for unordered pairs, we have to fold diagonal of square

we have to twist square -> then we get mobius strip

every point on mobius strip => unordered pair of points on closed loop

map mobius strip to the 3D surface

if strip intersects itself during this, that means there is a collision => it means there is a inscribed rectangle
