Aleph 0 : The derivative isn't what you think it is.

rules of geometry and calculus fail over weird spaces

extent of failure measures the number of holes 

in geometry, its called homology

in calculus, its called cohomology

they measure same holes - De Rham's theorem

# homology 

define hole, and distinguish different types of holes

to find holes, find a k-chain 

boundary of chain 

hole is chain with zero boundary that is not boundary of anything else

number of k-dim holes = dim of Hk group

# cohomology 

use differential forms, 

```
f(x).dx is integrated over 1-chain

f(x, y).dx.dy is integrated over 2-chain
```

use exterior derivative instead of grad, curl, div

a k-dim hole is a form with zero derivative thats not derivative of anything else

de Rham theorem : k-th homology and k-th cohomology group are isomorphic

homology(chains) and cohomology(forms) measure same thing

world of forms and chains 

derivative is opposite of the boundary
