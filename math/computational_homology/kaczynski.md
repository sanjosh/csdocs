given points in region

1. zeroth homology group = number of distinct pieces (lines)
2. first homology group = number of regions enclosed by lines (rect)
3. second = cavities
4. third = tomography of heart (3 space and 1 time dimension)

homology is not measuring size or even a speciﬁc shape; rather it measures very fundamental properties like the number of holes
and pieces.

Lefschetz ﬁxed-point theorem (see Theorem 10.46), guarantees the existence of a
ﬁxed point if the traces of the homology maps satisfy a simple condition

boundary operator : counting the algebraic objects modulo 2.

cycles

graphs
1. C0(G, Z2) = sum of vertices in Z2
2. C1(G, Z2) = sum of edges


## Chapter 2 Cubical Homology


## Chapter 3 computing 

we provide a purely algebraic algorithm for computing homology. 
This guarantees that homology groups are always computable. 
However, this method is extremely ineﬃcient. 

## Chapter 4 chain maps and reduction

we introduce reduction algorithms that are combinatorial in nature and reasonably fast.
