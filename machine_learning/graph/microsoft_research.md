learn F such that F(graph) = number

1. take features of node and create store them in state of node
2. at each edge, associate neural net, based on relationship
3. at each node, put RNN 
4. at each time t, they pull messages from neighbouring nodes.  the messages go thru NN

## history

* Graph neural network [Gori, 2005]
* Gated GNN [Li ICLR 2016]
* Spectral networks [bruna ICLR 2014]
* Chebynets [Defferrard NIPS 2016]
* Graph CNN [Kipf ICLR 2017]
* Neural message passing [Gilmer ICML 2017] - unifying paper; realized that convolutions converged on same architecture as GNN
* ASync neural message passing Liao
* AMPNet Gaunt
* Programs as Graphs Allamanis

# Applications

## chemistry

come up with new drug molecules using message passing in GNN

## software program understanding
