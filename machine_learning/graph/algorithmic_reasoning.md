Graph Representation Learning for Algorithmic Reasoning

learn representation of algorithmic manipulation : like sharing algo subroutines

1. DeepSets good for summary statistics
1. GNN good for pairwise relations

## What can neural networks reason about, Xu Li ICLR 20

GNN aligns with dynamic programming

## Deep Sets Zaheer NeurIPS 2017

## neural execution of graph algorithms Velickovic ICLR 20

## Neural execution engine Yan Swersky

used for selection sort

neural execution engines can be combined, even recursively
