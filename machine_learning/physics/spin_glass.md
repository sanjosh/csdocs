Spin glasses are magnetic systems with randomly distributed ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. The low-temperature phase of these systems—the
spin glass phase—is in many ways a prototype for condensation in disordered systems with conflicting constraint

Neural systems share several features with longrange spin glasses. 
(I will use the term "neural systems" for assemblies of real neurons.) 

The spatial configuration of the two systems bears no resemblance to the crystalline
order of pure magnets or solids. The couplings between
spins in spin glasses can be both positive and negative,
which is also true of the couplings between neurons. And
just as each spin in a long-range spin glass is connected to
many others, so is each neuron in most neural system
