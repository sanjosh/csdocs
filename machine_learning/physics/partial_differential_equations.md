# Navier Stokes

Navier-Stokes used to describe the motion of any fluid. 

“Solving” Navier-Stokes allows you to take a snapshot of the air’s motion (a.k.a. wind conditions) at any point in time and model how it will continue to move, or how it was moving before

Neural networks are function approximator 

define the inputs and outputs in Fourier space, which is a special type of graph for plotting wave frequencies.

it’s far easier to approximate a Fourier function in Fourier space than to wrangle with PDEs in Euclidean space,

# PDE

traditional neural networks learn highly non-linear functions, mapping between finite dim euclidean space

use GNN to learn non-linear operators/PDEs : mapping between infinite dim spaces

frame it as regression problem
