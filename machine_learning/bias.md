## being blind to a variable does not mean algo is not biased towards it


## dataset has bias

mexican restaurants ranked lower because word mexican has negative connotations

## vicious circle (runaway feedback loop)


 if you predict there's more crime in certain areas, you might send more police there, but because the more police there, they might make more arrests, which might cause you to think that there's more crime there, which might cause you to send even more police there, and you can easily get this runaway feedback loop.


## objections

1. Model is learning real world (no, they are amplifying them)
2. its an upstream/downstream problem


## solutions

1. debias the dataset
2. debias the decision
