# Between class learning

BC learning is a method to improve the classification performance by solving a problem of predicting the mixing ratio between two different classes.

We generate between-class sounds by mixing two sounds belonging to different classes with a random ratio. We then input the mixed sound to the model and train the model to output the mixing ratio.
