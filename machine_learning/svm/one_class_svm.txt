The Support Vector Method For Novelty Detection by Schölkopf et al. basically separates all the data points from the origin (in feature space F) and maximizes the distance from this hyperplane to the origin. This results in a binary function which captures regions in the input space where the probability density of the data lives. Thus the function returns +1 in a “small” region (capturing the training data points) and −1 elsewhere.


The method of Support Vector Data Description by Tax and Duin (SVDD) takes a spherical, instead of planar, approach. The algorithm obtains a spherical boundary, in feature space, around the data. The volume of this hypersphere is minimized, to minimize the effect of incorporating outliers in the solution.

##  Misc

Now, SVMs are max-margin methods, i.e. they do not model a probability distribution. 

find a function that is positive for regions with high density of points, and negative for small densities.

The idea is to have an estimate of he support of the (unknown) probability distribution from which the samples have been obtained.
