neural turing machine - from deepmind

during back prop, gradient update is added if original input was distributedin forward pass.
how does backprop work if both inputs same at max gate ? no
is there ever be a loop in RNN ? No, its get unfolded.

Since input is vector, derivatives are Jacobian matrix 
In practice, Jacobian matrix is not instantiated

Brain analogy is broken
1) many diff types of biological neurons
2) dendrites can perform complex nonlinear comp
3) synapses are complex non-linear dynamical system (not single weight)
4) rate code may not be adequate

Activation func
* Sigmoid
* tanh
* ReLU : network converge faster
* Leaky ReLU
* Maxout ELU

Regularization : 

hidden layer warps the input space to enable the second hidden layer to linearly classify. Also called kernel trick - 

what is min number of neurons in hidden layer to linearly separate ?
