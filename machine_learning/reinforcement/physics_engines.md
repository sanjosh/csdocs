## Contact dynamics 

linear complementarity problem (LCP), 

spring-damper model

## coordinates

joint coordinates

cartesian

# Mujoco

forward dynamics

inverse dynamics

## elements of model

body, joint, dof, geom, site, constraint, tendon, actuator

## Mujoco compare with Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)

The three orders-of-magnitude speed advantage over ODE can be broken down as follows: 
1. one order of magnitude is due to faster computation, 
2. one order of magnitude is due to parallel processing which fully utilizes all available processors, 
3. one order of magnitude is due to higher accuracy and stability allowing larger time-steps;
