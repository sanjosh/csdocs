Power of self learning systems, Demis Hassabis - Mar 2019

https://cbmm.mit.edu/video/power-self-learning-systems

expert systems(harcoded rules, preprogrammed, inspired by logic) vs learning systems (first principles, generalize, inspired by neuroscience)

1. alphago : bootstrap from human games
2. alphago-zero : learn from first principles
3. alpha-zero : play any 2 player game from scratch

Stockfish had hundreds of rules.  Replaced them by "reinforcement learning + monte-carlo tree search"

# AlphaZero

Policy Network, Value network
100k self play games
generate synthetic training data
Use new traning data to train new network

AlphaZero discovered 7 new themes and strategies in chess

# AlphaStar

from 35 min

starcraft-2 
1. partially observable
2. long term dependency
3. massive action space
4. real time and multiplayer

start with supervised learning.  move to reinforcement learning.
