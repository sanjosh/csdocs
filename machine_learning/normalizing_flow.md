# Normalizing flow

Normalizing Flows are a method for constructing complex distributions by transforming 
a probability density through a series of invertible mappings. By repeatedly applying 
the rule for change of variables, the initial density ‘flows’ through the sequence 
of invertible mappings. At the end of this sequence we obtain a valid probability 
distribution and hence this type of flow is referred to as a normalizing flow.
