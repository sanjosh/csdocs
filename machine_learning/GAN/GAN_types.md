# Primordial Vanilla GAN

# WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)

# Cycle GAN

# DiscoGAN

# DCGAN

# Laplacian GAN (LAPGAN)

# Conditional GAN

the generator learns to generate a fake sample with a specific condition or characteristics (such as a label associated with an image or more detailed tag) rather than a generic sample from unknown noise distribution

# InfoGAN

# BEGAN (Boundary equilibrium GAN)

# Bayesian GAN

# Bidirectional GAN  (BiGAN)

provides inference mechanism - invert the generator

# ALI (Adversarially learned Inference)

provides inference mechanism - invert the generator

# Adversarial auto-encoder (AAE)

# SRGAN

# SeqGAN
