the theory simplifies X (information compression). the theory can predict X (information gain).

## Simplicity: Identifying relevant variables.

We found that weight norm is highly correlated with overfitting and generalization

 memorization circuit has a large weight norm, while the generalization circuit has a small weight norm

## Dynamics: Viewing the world dynamically

how does the neural network transit from the large norm state to the small norm state

## Intuition: Forming mental pictures


## Control: Eliminate grokking
