# Levels
1. phonetic analysis(speech)

## Text to speech

1. Speaker mimicry (AANN)

1. Keyphrase detection : two people said same thing
2. Speech/Non-speech segmentation
3. Voice/Unvoiced speech (V-UV) classifier : Audio can have voice, unvoiced and silence components - called V/U/S classification
4. Voice activity detection (VAD) aka Speech Activity detection (SAD).  This is more general problem than speech/nonspeech
5. Speech/Music separation
6. Onset detection
7. Endpoint detection : when did voice end
8. Speaker identification
9. Speaker source separation
9. ASR (acoustic model + language model)
10. Music Genre classification
