# Overview

supervector = speaker independent + speaker dependent + channel dependent + residual component

1. i-vector (Dehak, et al 2011)
2. d-vector in DNN
3. X-vector (Snyder, et al 2017)
3. supervised versus unsupervised
4. speaker change detection versus diarization

# Speaker change detection

1. energy based - uses VAD
2. distance based - maxima of distances between adjacent windows

Bayesian information criterion
One class SVM
