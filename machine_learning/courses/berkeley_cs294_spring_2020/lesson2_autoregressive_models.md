# Basics

Chain rule

Bayes network

Max likelihood model

Applications
1. Anomaly detection
2. Data compression
3. Data generation

# Histograms

Doesn't work in higher dimensions

# Autoregressive models

##  RNN

## Autoregressive Masking models

### Masked autoencoder for distribution estimation (MADE) : outputs probability of any image

How do we know probability sums to 1 ?  Softmax

### Masked Convolutions

Examples are Wavenet, PixelNet
