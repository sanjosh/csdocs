CS231n Winter 2016: Lecture 8: Localization and Detection

purpose of pooling is subsampling, downsize

Different problems
1. Classification 
2. Classification + Localization : find a fixed obj
3. Object Detection : variable number of objects
4. Instance segmentation

--------------
Problem 2 is Classification + localization

Localization can be framed as regression problem


DeepPose model for human poses
OverLeaf model

ResNet + RPN (Region Proposal network)
Outliers are bad with L2 loss  - use L1 loss

--------------
Problem 3 is Object detection

In ML, think of a problem as classification or regression !
Think of detection as classification..

Need to test many positions and scales

Region Proposal Network is a class agnostic object detector
find blob like regions likely to contain objects

Different types of proposed Region Proposal
1. Selective Search : merge adjacent pixels to form blobs - convert to box
do this over multiple scales
2. EdgeBoxes
3. Geodesic
4. many more

see paper Hosang et al. What makes for effective detection proposals. PAMI 2015

R-CNN
RoI pooling

See paper from deepmind. spatial transformer networks

Hu. Deep residual learning for image recognition


Think of detection as regression
That is approach taken by YOLO  - Redmon
