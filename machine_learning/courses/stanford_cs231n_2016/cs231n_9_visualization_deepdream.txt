Visualization methods

---------------

Visualize a neuron
Gabor like filters always occur on first layer
---------------

Visualize weights
---------------

Visualize codes 
Use t-SNE visualization to visualize
You see clusters
---------------

Occlusion experiments
Slide patch of zeros through image
creates heat map 
you find probability of a dog change as image slides
---------------

Visualizing activations
https://yosinski.com/deepvis
Paper in 2015.  Yosinski. Understanding neural nets through deep visualization.  ICML DL 2015

Two approaches 
1.  Deconv-based visualization
 		How to compute gradient at any neuron wrt image 
 		Do guided backprop

 		Zeiler and Fergus. Visualizing and understanding convolutional networks 
 		Simonyan 2014. Deep inside convolutional network
 		Springenberg 2015.  striving for simplicity
	
2.  Optimization-based (more intuitive)
    find an image that maximizes some class score.

		DO IMAGE UPDATES RECURSIVELY
		start with zero image
		set gradient to be all zero except for 1 one
		backprop to image
		do small image update
		forward image thru network

receptive field of neuron is larger as you go deeper into CNN layer

Given a CNN, is it possible to reconstruct image from output code ?
Mahendran.  Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting them.
Information is lost

------------------

github.com/google/deepdream
Boosts all activations at any layer
creates feedback loop 

Inception Net ?

ImageNet has 1000 classes, but 200 of them are dogs 
thats why deepdream shows dogs

Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style - Gatys, Ecker and Bethge

deepart.io

content image and style image

put content image thru ConvNet - extract the activations
activations match content

put style image thru ConvNet
style of painting is recorded in gram matrices (outer product)
the features that fired together is style
texture stored in pairwise activations ?

Szegedy Intriguing properties of neural networks
Nguyen, Yosinski.  Deep neural networks are easily fooled

Goodfellow.  Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples
primary cause is linear nature of functions used in forward pass

same problem in linear classifiers


--------------

Summary
Backprop to image is powerful technique used for
visualization
segmenting
inverting codes
fun - painting and deep dream
adversarial examples
