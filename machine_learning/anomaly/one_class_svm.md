regularization param "c" of SVM is replaced by slack parameter (mu) indicating how many outliers to allow

better to use RBF kernel in one-class SVM because we do not want to find linear hyperplane but we want to find a circle/boundary

higher "mu" indicates tighter boundary

other hyperparam is gamma (radius of boundary)
