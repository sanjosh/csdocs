Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of the value of a predictor (x) on a given class (c) is independent of the values of other predictors.

Kononenko's information gain as a sum of information contributed by each attribute can offer an explanation on how values of the predictors influence the class probability.

The contribution of predictors can also be visualized by plotting nomograms.
