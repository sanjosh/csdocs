Navier-Stokes used to describe the motion of any fluid. 

“Solving” Navier-Stokes allows you to take a snapshot of the air’s motion (a.k.a. wind conditions) at any point in time and model how it will continue to move, or how it was moving before

Neural networks are function approximator 

define the inputs and outputs in Fourier space, which is a special type of graph for plotting wave frequencies.

it’s far easier to approximate a Fourier function in Fourier space than to wrangle with PDEs in Euclidean space,
