# label schema

* Cookiecutter — provides a file-structure to help organize your code
* CVAT — computer vision annotation tool that can help you figure out the structure and available options for annotations for vision tasks
* pandas — use a pandas DataFrame to store your labels to reduce the amount of scripting needed to update your dataset

# data loading

RoboFlow: an annotation service with a tool to convert between computer vision formats like COCO, TFRecords, and Pascal VOC

# model repo

* TensorFlow Hub: a collection of models that you can use to understand the input/output formats your desired model expects
* Papers with code: find the current state-of-the-art datasets and models and follow their formats

# Model versioning

* MLflow: open-source tools for tracking parameters and results of your experiments while also providing functionality to package and deploy your models
* Weights & Biases: cloud-based solution for experiment tracking and model/dataset versioning that allows for easy sharing with collaborators

# eval

* pycocotools: automatically compute mAP for object detection problems following the COCO dataset evaluation
* FiftyOne: load your labeled visual dataset and model results and write custom queries to find problematic samples

# visualize

* seaborn: built on matplotlib with its own graphing library and formatting
* Plotly: one of the simplest plotting libraries in Python
* Bokeh: a visualization tool for creating interactive plots
* FiftyOne: open-source tool to visualize and search labeled image or video datasets with model predictions in the FiftyOne App
* Scale Nucleus: cloud-based tool to visualize and explore labeled image datasets
* Weights & Biases: cloud-based tool to visualize various data types including images, videos, and 3D object
