Triplet loss was originally proposed in the FaceNet (Schroff et al. 2015) paper and was used to learn face recognition of the same person at different poses and angles.

# SimCLR

It learns representations for visual inputs by maximizing agreement between differently augmented views of the same sample via a contrastive loss in the latent space.
