# Noisy labels

Frenay and Verleysen 2014

# Ways to deal with label noise

1. data cleaning

2. treat the (unknown) true labels as hidden variables and to estimate a generative or discriminative model.

3. Noise-resistant loss function : loss function based on mean absolute value of error is inherently robust to label noise.
