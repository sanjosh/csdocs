quantization of word vectors to save space

handle 
1) out of vocab words : use n-grams
2) misspelled words
3) concat words
4) rare words : common ngrams with frequent words will ensure good embedding
5) word disambiguation ? 

Classes
1) balanced => negative sampling
2) imbalanced => softmax
3) large num of classes => hierarchical softmax

hyperparam
1) min and max ngram
2) hash table size controlled by "-hash" 
3) word vector length controlled by "-dim"

training : HogWild (parallel SGD)
