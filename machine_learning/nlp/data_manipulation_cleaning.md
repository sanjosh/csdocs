# Pandas flavour (extend pandas)

We use pandas_flavor to register the function natively on a pandas.DataFrame.

Pandas 0.23 introduced a simpler API for extending Pandas. 
This API provided two key decorators, register_dataframe_accessor and register_series_accessor, 
that enable users to register accessors with Pandas DataFrames and Series.
