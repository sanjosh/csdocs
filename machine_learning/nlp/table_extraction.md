The lines tagging step assigns to each line a tag: text line (TxL), table line (TbL), unknown line (UnL). 

To construct blocks the same agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm [4] adopted for constructing segments is used. 

Columns are built by using vertical overlapping ratio among segments and distances among columns contained in table areas.
