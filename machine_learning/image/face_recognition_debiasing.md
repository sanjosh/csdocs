Domain Adaptation/Transfer learning

# InclusiveFacenet Sec 4.2

Given face crops similar to those from Picasa, we train a FaceNet model (Schroff et al., 2015) and extract features from the layer called avgpool. We add fully connected layers and then fine-tune the model for the race and gender classification tasks. Race and gender are learned from a held-out dataset with a uniform distribution across race and gender intersections.

# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

Our goal is to learn deep features invariant between domains and improve the performance of target images (faces of colored skin in our study) in an unsupervised manner.
