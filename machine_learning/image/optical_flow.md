# Optical flow

Optical flow is the motion of objects between consecutive frames of sequence, caused by the relative movement between the object and camera.

## Sparse optical flow

Track only a select set of pixels

There are various implementations of sparse optical flow, including the Lucas–Kanade method, the Horn–Schunck method, the Buxton–Buxton method, and more.

## dense optical flow

Track all pixels

Dense optical flow gives a more accurate result and a denser result suitable for applications such as learning structure from motion and video segmentation.

To address the issue of labeling training data, researchers used computer graphics to simulate massive realistic worlds. Since the worlds are generated by instruction, the motion of each and every point of an image in a video sequence is known. Some examples of such include MPI-Sintel, an open-source CGI movie with optical flow labeling rendered for various sequences, and Flying Chairs, a dataset of many chairs flying across random backgrounds also with optical flow labeling.

Solving optical flow problems with deep learning is an extremely hot topic at the moment, with variants of FlowNet, SPyNet, PWC-Net, and more each outperforming one another on various benchmarks.
