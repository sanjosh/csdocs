Multi-Object Representation Learning with Iterative Variational Inference
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00450.pdf

We represent each scene with K latent object representations that collaborate to generate the input image 

permutation invariance

image x is gaussian mixture model

iterative amortized inference

The other central parameter of IODINE is the number of slots K, as it controls the maximum number of objects
the system can separate
