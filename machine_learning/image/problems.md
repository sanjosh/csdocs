## semantic segmentation

assigning semantic labels

Object detection would identify the six people and give them a single label of person by creating bounding boxes around them. 
Semantic segmentation goes further and creates a mask over each person that was identified and gives all of them a single label of person. 
In instance segmentation, every instance a person gets its own label.
