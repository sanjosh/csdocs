# generative 

learns joint probability p(x,y) where y is label for x and then uses Bayes rule to find posterior

1. naive bayes
2. HMM

types of generative :

1. GANs
2. Flow Models
3. Autoregressive Models 

Energy based models https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_based_model

# discriminative 

learns conditional probability P(y | x) - learn posterior directly
1. logistic regression (naive bayes)
2. conditional random fields (HMM)
