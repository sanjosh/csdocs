the solution to a problem is underspecified if there are many distinct solutions that solve the problem equivalently.

Finally, these results suggest a need for training and evaluation techniques tailored
to address underspecification, such as flexible methods to constrain ML pipelines toward the credible
inductive biases for each specific applicatio
