# metric type

## MAE

## MSE 

sensitive to outliers

## RMSE

better than MSE because units are same

RMSE = 5 minutes is easier to understand than MSE = 25.

## MAPE

MAPE is 8% means “On average, our predictions are off by 8%"

Bad if true values can be zero (division by zero problem in calculation).

## SMAPE

Fixes: MAPE’s asymmetry and division-by-zero problem.


## Huber

combination of MSE and MAE

## R2

Proportion of variance in the target explained by the model

value of 1 is good, zero means mean. less than zero means worse than random
