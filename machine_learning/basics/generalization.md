Weight Watcher analyzes the Fat Tails in the weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

well trained neural networks weights are not random (of course).   
The weights are correlated.   
By analyzing the eigenvalue distributions of weight matrices, there are things you can say about how well the model generalizes.
