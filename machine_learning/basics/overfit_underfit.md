# how to solve Underfit

e.g. using linear model for non-linear data

1. debug 
2. tune optimizer
3. increase model size

# how to solve overfit

1. more data
2. change model architecture/feature engineer
3. data augmentation/regularization
4. use features from existing model which is more richer

1. L2 norm regularization
2. L1 norm regularization
3. dropout regularization
4. early stopping
