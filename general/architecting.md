# sweet spot

will work for upto 10x load of today

easy to build on

ability to reason about it 

optimize the common case 

# incremental but must have low migration cost

things which won't change must be decided (one way door)


# operational efficiency 

simpler is easier to manage : only need to know few knobs for each module

reduce oncall load on engineers

ability to switch off failing parts

ability to audit and monitor running system

ability to quickly recover from disaster or failure

# cost balance

actual money

technical skills required

customer satisfaction


# future-proof

meet growth for next 1-2 years

must reduce effort to change tech stack 

# reliable tech

tools and dependencies are proven to be reliable

time taken to deliver a new feature

# migration 

1. poc
1. double-write
1. backfill
1. blue-green
1. switch-over 

# protect data and schema 

the compute can keep changing with use-cases
