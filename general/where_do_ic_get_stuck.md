Individual Contributors often get sidetracked by

1. Brainstorming/architecture: “I must have thought through all edge cases of all parts of everything before I can begin this project”
2. Researching possible solutions forever (often accompanied by desire to do a “bakeoff” where they build prototypes in different platforms/languages/etc)
3. Refactoring: “this code could be cleaner and everything would be just so much easier if we cleaned this up… and this up… and…”
4. Helping other people instead of doing their assigned tasks
5. Jumping on fires even when not on-call
6. Working on side projects instead of the main project
7. Excessive testing (rare)
8. Excessive automation (rare)

Individual Contributors often get stuck when they need to…

1. Finish the last 10–20% of a project
2. Start a project completely from scratch
3. Do project planning (You need me to write what now? A roadmap?)
4. Work with unfamiliar code/libraries/systems
5. Work with other teams (please don’t make me go sit with data engineering!!)
6. Talk to other people (in engineering, or more commonly, outside of engineering)
7. Ask for help (far beyond the point they realized they were stuck and needed help)
8. Deal with surprises or unexpected setbacks
9. Navigate bureaucracy
10. Pull the trigger and going into prod
11. Deal with vendors/external partners
12. Say no, because they can’t seem to just say no (instead of saying no they just go into avoidance mode, or worse, always say yes)
