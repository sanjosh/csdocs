# why comments in code

1. language and tools do not yet ensure self-documenting
2. people churn
3. solving problems not solved before
4. change can have global side-effects; no other way to track that 
5. novice engineers tend to write unreadable code without proper abstractions

# why not comments

1. can get out-dated and misleading
