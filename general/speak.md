1. promise something to the audience - start with takeaway.  don't start with joke
2. repeat the idea 3 times
3. build a fence - distinguish from other ideas
4. verbal punctuation (use it as landmark to get back on in case audience is lost)
5. ask a question - involve audience
6. best time is 11 am; keep lights full on; check the place
7. board better for speed, graphical quality, use it as target of hang
8. use of props - they provide physical analogy and empathy
9. slides are for exposing ideas rather than teaching them. they should accompany speech and not be read, keep position of slides close to speaker, have fewer words, simple images.  when slides have lot of words, no one pays attention to the speaker.  decide minimum font size.  no laser pointer.  
10. inspire - by demonstrating passion
11. how to think - storytelling, how to ask questions, analyzing, correlating
12. persuading.  oral exams - how to situate and how to practice
13. persuading.  job talks - vision, done something (list steps)
14. persuading.  associate work with a new symbol, slogan, nomenclature.  have a surprise.  have a salient idea.  tell the story
15. don't end with collaborators, thank you, questions, url links.  instead list the summary of talk

# UX slides

1. Use a consistent color palette having 3-4 colors.
2. use layering  (ask the UX designers what this means exactly)
3. using different font sizes to bring out contrast
4. using well-known icons – like stop sign – instead of inventing your own.
5. other misc things I had to correct – avoid red color since it’s a subconscious danger signal, no need to put boxes around text since it breaks visual flow, etc.
