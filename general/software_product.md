## A software product typically requires

* API with consistent grammar
* Debugging options
* Error handling and degraded operation
* Persistence/serialization format
* Networking protocol
* Locking strategies
* Performance counters and resource usage information.
* Command-shell or administration GUI
* Configuration options
* Export/import of internal data
* Version upgrades (ideally with no downtime)
* Security (authentication, encryption, license management).
* Easy installation and uninstallation.

## Three problems to solve during product design:
* Algorithmic : core product.
* Integrational : with other software.
* Operational : administrative issues.

## Stages of product evolution
* Framework : skeletal working
* Functional : functionality working.
* Optimization and durability : improve algorithms and run it over long periods without resource leaks.
* Interoperability : with other software.
* User-friendly : fine-tuning.
* Adaptive intelligence : internally detect and adapt to different usage patterns.
