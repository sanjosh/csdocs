Parametric I/O Model (PIO) that captures contemporary devices by parameterizing read/write asymmetry (Î±) and access concurrency (k). PIO enables device-specific decisions at algorithm design time, rather than as an optimization during deployment and testing, thus ensuring optimal algorithm design by taking into account the properties of each device.
