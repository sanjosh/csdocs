# estimation statistics

hypothesis testing tells you if samples are different  
but how to quantify the size of difference between samples

1. effect size : how much samples differ
2. interval estimate : quantify the uncertainty
3. meta analysis

# effect size

* association : degree to which samples change together
* difference : degree to which samples are different (cohen d statistic)

# interval estimate

* tolerance interval : bounds on observations; decreases as sample size increases
* confidence interval : uncertainty of estimate
* prediction interval

# meta analysis
