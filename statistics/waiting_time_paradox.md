cases
1. infinite buses
2. multiple lanes for buses

## average waiting time for next train 

`E[W] = E(T^2)/2.E(T)`

if Bus arrival = Poisson process with Lambda = Average arrival rate

and X = waiting time, which follows exp distribution 

then E[X] = 1/Lambda

## average waiting time if k people at stop

Expected waiting time if number of waiting people = k

n - E[X | N=k ]

# friendship paradox

most people have fewer friends than their friends have.

Scott Feld, “Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do”, American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 96, №6 (May, 1991), pp. 1464–1477.


# road race : slower runners are much slower, faster runners much faster

if you stand at a random spot and watch runners go by, you see a representative sample of speeds. 

But if you jump into the race in the middle, the sample you see depends on your speed.

# prison sentence 

If you arrive at a prison at a random time and choose a random prisoner, you are more likely to choose a prisoner with a long sentence. Once again, a prisoner with sentence x is oversampled by a factor of x.
