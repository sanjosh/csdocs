Depends on distribution of bus arrival
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/52493/average-wait-time-arriving-at-subway-randomly

average waiting time for next train = `E[W] = E(T^2)/2.E(T)`

if Bus arrival = Poisson process with Lambda = Average arrival rate
and X = waiting time, which follows exp distribution 
then E[X] = 1/Lambda
