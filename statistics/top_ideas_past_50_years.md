## Counterfactual causal inference

modeling causal questions in terms of counterfactuals or potential outcomes,

## bootstrapping and simulation based inference

consider the bootstrap distribution as an approximation to the sampling distribution of the data.

## overparameterized models and regularization

get the flexibility of a nonparametric or highly parameterized approach, while avoiding the overfitting problem

Regularization can be implemented as a penalty function on the parameters or on the predicted curve

examples : 
1. markov random fields, 
2. gaussian process, 
3. classification and regression tree, 
4. neural network
5. lasso, horseshoe regression
6. SVM

unsupervised learning methods for finding structures and decompositions.
1. non-negative matrix factorization
2. nonlinear dimension reduction
3. GAN

## multilevel models

allowing models to adapt to 
1. cluster sampling, 
2. longitudinal studies, 
3. time-series cross-sectional data, 
4. meta-analysis, and other structured setting

framework for combining different sources of information, and as such it arises whenever we wish to make inferences from a subset of data (small-area estimation) or to generalize data to new problems (meta-analysis)

## generic computation algorithms

1. EM
2. gibbs sampler
3. particle filter
4. variational inference
5. expectation propagation
6. metropolis MCMC


## adaptive decision analysis

## robust inference

## exploratory data analysis
