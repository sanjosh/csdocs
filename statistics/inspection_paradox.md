Scott Feld, “Why Your Friends Have More Friends Than You Do”, American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 96, №6 (May, 1991), pp. 1464–1477.

```
by recognizing the difference
between the distribution of numbers of friends of individuals 
and the distribution of the numbers of friends of friends

distribution of friends of friends includes some of the same individuals over and over

The distribution of friends among friends is a weighted version of the original
distribution, weighting those with many friends especially heavily; this
weighting counteracts the original skew, as shown in figure 3b. The
important characteristic of the distribution of numbers of friends of
friends is that it inevitably has a higher mean than the distribution of
friends of individuals

# class size paradox

sampling bias

```
students experience the average class size as being larger than it is. They
experience a higher average class size than exists for the college because
many students experience the large classes, while few students experience
the small classes

# road race 

slower runners are much slower, faster runners much faster

if you stand at a random spot and watch runners go by, you see a representative sample of speeds. 

But if you jump into the race in the middle, the sample you see depends on your speed.

# prison sentence 

```
If you arrive at a prison at a random time and choose a random prisoner, 
you are more likely to choose a prisoner with a long sentence. 
Once again, a prisoner with sentence x is oversampled by a factor of x.
