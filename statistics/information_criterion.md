find the best model

combat overfitting by penalizing free parameters, reduce model complexity

lower is better

# AIC Akaike

Akaike measure the goodness of fit for particular model by balancing the error of the fit against the number of parameters in the model

# BIC bayesian

AIC is better in situations when a false negative finding would be considered more misleading than a false positive, 
BIC is better in situations where a false positive is as misleading as, or more misleading than, a false negative.

AIC is best for prediction as it is asymptotically equivalent to cross-validation.
BIC is best for explanation as it is allows consistent estimation of the underlying data generating process.
