space complexity for online algorithm to compute freq moment

http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/el327/datamining2013aFiles/04_frequency_moments.pdf

Need good estimator for each moment

Let A = (a1, a2, ..., am)
Let m_i = number of j such that a_j = i (frequency)

Fk = Sigma (m_i^k)  for i = 1 to n

F0 F1 F2 can be approx in log space

F0 = count of distinct elem 

 find hash func h: a -> [0, 1]
 define random variable X = min over all i (hash (a_i))
 then X is roughly 1/m
 and 1/X is fair estimate of actual m

F1 = length of stream  


F2 = repeat rate or Gini index of homogeneity (frequency square)

rest require O(n) space
