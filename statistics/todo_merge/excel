Typing "=" activates a cell

use $ for absolute reference to a call
In some cell, type "=B6(1 + $C$3)" <- cell B6 and cell C3
without $ it becomes a relative reference
In Cell B7, type "=B6*3".  If you copy B7 to B8, formula changes to "=B7*3"

Putting hyphen (') before the formula (i.e. '=6-4) allows the formula to be displayed

Functions on individual cells
type "= ln(1.5)" in cell

Functions on set of numbers/array
type "=average(D4:D20)" or "=stdev.P(D4:D20)"

Functions on ordered pairs of numbers
= slope(D4:D20, E4:E20) - regression line
= intercept(D4:D20, E4:E20)
= correl(array1, array2)

Use solver plugin to find x for which y = f(x)

Charting : Select all rows, select Charts and then Scatter
