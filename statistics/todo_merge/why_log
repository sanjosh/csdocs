log = displays order of magniture

=====================

Why do economists take log of ratios ?
because 
  Pn = (1 + r/n)^n. P1

limit (1 + r/n)^n = exp(r)

So if rate of interest is "r", money grows at Pn/P1 = exp(r)
Taking natural log is just inverse
ln(Pn/P1) = r

So ln(Pn/P1) is telling you rate of return in terms of compounded interest

For low values of r, compounded is same as non-compounded
e.g. (P2-P1)/P1 = ln(P2/P1) when (a/b) is near 1 (since ln(x) = x-1 when x is near 1)

Using logs is better than simple percent changes
Simple percent increase in 50% and decrease in 50% doesnt get back to where you were.
Whereas log change in 0.5 followed by "-0.5" is the same.
