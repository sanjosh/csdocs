In R

1) Full factorial
use expand.grid()
or use gen.factorial() from AlgDesign package

2) Fractional Factorial design
use FrF2 package
and call FrF2(num runs, num factors)

3) Blocking 
Conf.design package

========================================

each Factor has levels
Interaction is called Confounding
Replication means repeat experiment ro find errors

contrasts matrix

Imagine eqn
  y = q_0 + q_1 * F_1 + q_2 * F_2 + q_12 * F_12
where

SST = total variation
 = Sum of variation due to each factor
 + sum of variation due to interaction between factors
 + sum of variation due to error

 Variation is not Variance

 Columns are orthogonal

 Stages:
 1) first use 2 levels to find primary factors
 2) Then explore more than 2 levels for primary factors

If using replication, then you can add error term
  y = q_0 + q_1 * F_1 + q_2 * F_2 + q_12 * F_12 + SSE

Compute variance of errors
Compute confidence intervals for effects

Additive model
Multiplicative model - replace factors by their log
Box-Cox power transforms
