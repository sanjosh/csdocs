check multicollinearity by computing condition number

ununsual and influential data
1. outliers
2. leverage
3. influence : 

case influence statistics
1. high cook's distance implies a point will change regression estimates
2. high leverage implies point has potential to be influential
3. high studentized residual implies point unusual compared to model mean

heteroscedastic
1. non-constant variance

multicollinearity
1. non-independence

Mallow's Cp to assess fit of model

---------------

if you control for too many things, it increases standard error

(Andrew Gellman)
constant treatment effect
interaction is greater than main effect - invalidates study
