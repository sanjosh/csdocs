If data distribution is not known, cannot run ANOVA
So non parametric tests come in

Kruskal-Wallis test = ANOVA
Friedman test = two-way ANOVA (works only in completely balanced design)

Post-hoc testing?

If data doesnt fit Kruskal-Wallis or Friedman test, replace original
data with ranks (use new.var = rank(old.var)) and then do ANOVA
