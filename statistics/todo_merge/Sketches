Given set of items, let f_i = frequency of item i

find largest f_i = heavy hitter
find non-zero f_i = count distinct
find entropy

FM sketch for F0 count distinct - (flajolet martin) 

if d distinct values, d/2 map to 1, d/4 to 2

eventually
leftmost has 111
rightmost has 000
middle has 01010
rightmost zero = indicator of log(d)

d = k.2^R for k= 1.3
take average over many copies

K-min values algo (KMV)

Hyperloglog

each item i in range [1..m]
pick random hash func hash: [m]->R
track the t distinct items achieving smallest value of hash(i)
let v_t = t'th smallest distinct value of hash(i)
if n = F0 < t
INCOMPLETE
