How to normalize
x/x_max - is prone to outliers

GIven X has Normal(mean, stddev)
then (X-mean)/stdev has Normal(0, 1)

Standard score
1) (x - median)/stddev - robust to outliers, but computationally expensive
2) (x - mean)/stddev <- Standardized
3) (x - x_low)/(x_max - x_low) <- Normalized

A key point is that calculating z requires the population mean and the
population standard deviation, not the sample mean or sample deviation. It
requires knowing the population parameters
