1) given stream of incoming pts, find number of pts in a range
   used by query optimizer, networking, iot

   numbers vs strings vs 2-dim

   how many buckets to create 
   what if query range doesnt match bucket

   Minimize error, running time

   handle updates & deletes 
   single-dim
   multi-dimensional
   distributed
   Arrival model vs Turnstile model

 ======================

3) equi-depth vs equi-width

4) V-optimal - SQL server

5) T-digest : IOT

6) Q-digest 

7) Histogram
 same problem in different areas
 statistics - density estimation (non-parametric)
 graphics - segmentation algo
 signal processing - convert time to frequency domain

7) Spark RDD Histogram method
 - DoubleRDDfunctions
 
better to approx CDF instead of PDF since CDF is contnuous


Histogram using MapReduce
DYnamic Histogram - Vitter & wang

========================

Sampling vs no-sampling
Online vs offline

(gibbons) three problems
1. estimating the frequency moments of a data set 
   as the number of distinct values or the maximum frequency of any one value
2. estimating the m most frequently occurring values
3. approximating the quantiles and other types of histograms of a data set

===========

NO SAMPLING : 

Network Data processing, Streaming, IOT

what can be computed in one pass ?
provide intuition

Associated problems
1. update/delete
2. multi-column
3. distributed - aggregate

Question of estimator

min
max
average
std deviation

moving average - Holt winters 

set membership - Bloom
entropy  - 
outliers - 

cardinality - count of distinct elem (freq moments)
rank stats - TDigest
heavy hitters - Stream summary algo
histogram - 

Find an estimator - bias, variance, mse, efficient
