BETA
****************************
Beta distribution is best for representing a probabilistic distribution 
of probabilities- the case where we don't know what a probability 
is in advance, but we have some reasonable guesses.

Beta distribution gets updated with new info

A, B are starting params
Beta(A + success, B  + failures)

Order statistics : If u generate several random (0,1) random numbers
and sort them, what is distribution of the 3rd one

If you stop a program at random "n" times, and "s" of those times (s>1)
it is doing something you could get rid of, then 
fraction of time saved by doing so = Beta(s+1, (n-s) + 1) and 
Speedup factor has BetaPrime distribution

Beta(a,b) has mean = a/(a+b) and variance ab/[(a+b)^2 (a+b+1)]
Uniform distribu = Beta(1, 1)

After 90 pos and 10 negative, we have Beta(91, 11) distrib

Beta = conjugate prior of Bernoulli distribution

beta distribution essentially defines the probability that a Bernoulli
experiment's success probability is p, given the outcome of the experiment.

if you have an unknown probability like the bias of a coin that you 
are estimating by repeated coin flips, then the likelihood induced 
on the unknown bias by a sequence of coin flips is beta-distributed.

Beta and Gamma

Given 2 Gamma distributions X and Y
X/(X+Y) has Beta distribution

Gamma = can model arrival time for independent events
Fraction of time spent in completing one of two tasks perfomed in sequence
lends itself to Beta distribution

Dirichlet distribution is multidim generalization of Beta
