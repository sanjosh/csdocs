Binary classification

Receiver Operating Characteristic curve invented in London bombing
to distinguish between bombers and seagulls on radar
Area under curve used to discriminate signal from noise
x = false positive rate
y = true positive rate

ROC Curve : ratio of false positive/true positive at a particular threshold

Confusion Matrix

At each threshold
False positive rate = false positive/ total number of neg events 
True positive rate = true pos/ total number of pos events

Plot these points for each threshold
Area under curve

Need cost function - because False positives are more expensive
put your threshold based on cost of false pos vs false neg

Prob(pos given pos test) = pos predictive value
Prob(neg given neg test) = neg predictive value
