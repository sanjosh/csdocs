    central limit theorem :  distrib of average of large numberof iid will be approx normal.  The astonishing fact is that this theorem says that a normal distribution arises regardless of the initial distribution. Even if our population has a skewed distribution, which occurs when we examine things such as incomes or peopleâ€™s weights, a sampling distribution for a sample with a sufficiently large sample size will be normal.

    Law of Large Numbers : if we take a sample (n) observations of our random variable & avg the observation(mean)-- it will approach the expected value E(x) of the random variable
