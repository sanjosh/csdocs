Hypothesis testing  - two approaches
1) Critical value approach
2) P-Value approach

Null hypothesis : Defendant is innocent
Test : Is evidence overwhelming to reject null hypothesis
P-value : how likely is the data, given defendant is innocent

If result being attributed to random chance is very small, 
then we reject null hypothesis - i.e result is statistically significant

If the P-value is less than (or equal to) α, then the null hypothesis 
is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. And, if the P-value 
is greater than α, then the null hypothesis is not rejected.

============

Every test has a paired equivalent

=========

ANOVA works best when sample sies are equal
F-statistic : used in ANOVA

F-distribution = ratio of 2 independent chi-square variables
divided by their respective degrees of freedom

F-test designed to test if two population variances are equal
F-test is test in which test statistic has F-distribution under null hypothesis

=========

T-Test : determine statistical diff between 2 samples
estimate population parameter (mean or stddev)

T-test is special case of F-test where u have 2 treatments
F = t^2
Both special cases of linear regression

=========
Paired  T-test : for samples collected as matched pairs

=========

Mann-Witney U-test : test for significant differences between 2 samples
when data are non-parametric.  In R, called Wilcoxon test.

=========
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test : test if 2 samples drawn from same distribution, 
or if sample drawn from reference distribution;

=========
Levene statistic : test homogenity of variance

=========
Chi-squared test : test if 2 categorical variables are indep

Statistical goodness test
Chi-square test : determine if observed prob distrib is same as expected.

Chi^2 = Sum (i=0, N-1) (Oi - Ei)^2/Ei
Compare this value to chi-squared distribution with N degrees of freedom
obtain p-value for result

For each degree of freedom, there is a diff chi-square distrib

The mean of the chi square distribution is the degree of freedom and 
the standard deviation is twice the degrees of freedom

Chart has y-axis = P(Chi^2), x-axis = Chi^2

if the a = 0.05 level of significance is selected, 
and there are 7 degrees of freedom, 
then the critical chi square value is 14.067. 
This means that for 7 degrees of freedom, there is exactly 0.05 
of the area under the chi square distribution that 
lies to the right of χ^2 = 14.067
