when distribution spans order of magnitude, benford's law makes appearance

frequency of leading digit of number shows exponential decay
digit 1 appears about 3rd time
digit 9 appears almost negligible

1. populations of all countries 
2. areas of countries
3. all numbers on front page of newspaper

will not work for

1. human heights

benford's law is explained by scale of variance.  

[1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 19]  <- frequency of leading digit 1 rises
[1, 2, 9, 10, 11, ... 90]  <- frequency of leading digit 1 goes down
[1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 101, 102, 103, ... ]  <- frequency of leading digit 1 rises again

if you pick number from distribution which spans order of magnitude, the mean/average is like a sawtooth waveform

Probability(leading digit is d) = Log_10(1 + 1/d)
