# experiment types

quasi-experiment

1. RCT randomized control trials - A/B
2. synthetic control
3. switchback experiments (time split)

# issues

1. network effects (interference) : users outside test group are effected by changed behaviour
2. carryover or spillover effect : can be reduced in switchback by ignoring some lag duration (washout period)
3. user learning effect (familiarization, learning bias) : mitigate 
4. novelty effect : account for time since exposure
5. impact estimation bias :
6. hawthorne effect (being observed changes behaviour)

# MDE

minimum detectable effect
