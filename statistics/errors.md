## problems

1. small sample size
2. unlimited degrees of freedom
3. large measurement errors
4. small effect size (relationship between variables)

solution : Type S & type M instead of type 1 and type 2 errors

## statistical power

probability that a study will find a statistically significant effect if one is actually present.

studies with larger samples have more power.

## statistically significant

 “statistically significant” if its p-value is less than 0.05; 

if there is less than a 1-in-20 chance that the observed pattern in the data would have occurred if there were really nothing going on in the population

## standard error

Standard error is a measure of the variation in an estimate 
gets smaller as a sample size gets larger, 
converging on zero as the sample increases in size

## effect sizes

strength of relationship between two variables

(mean of experimental group - mean of control group) / std dev

## power of test

probability it correctly rejects null hypothesis

## type S Sign error

probablity that estimate is in the opposite direction of the true effect.

## type M magnitude error/exaggeration factor

factor by which magnitude of effect is overestimated

## multiple comparisons problem


## design analysis (retrodesign R package)
