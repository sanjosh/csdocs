# five things learned - toufic boubez - metafor

## cannot use parametric methods on normal distributions 

## concept drift happens.  

yesterday's anomaly is today's normal; cannot use supervised learning

## kolmogorov-smirnov is good

makes no assumptions

compares distance between distributions

## use domain knowledge

## learn from sparse data
