# definition

no trend, no seasonality

constant mean, variance and auto-correlation

a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term. 

Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behaviour is possible), with constant variance.

if {y_t} is stationary, then for all s, distribution {y_t, ..., y_t+s} does not depend on t

if the cycle is aperiodic, series is stationary because timing of cycles is not predictable

# how to check stationarity 

1. summary statistics
2. unit root tests

## summary statistics

partition time series, compute mean and variance of each partition, and check if difference is statistically significant

look at histogram

if ADF statistic < critical value(5 perc), then reject null hypothesis and say time series is stationary

run linear regression of "difference of consecutive" wrt original time series
the t-statistic of this is the ADF

## Trend and Seasonality from scratch

1. fit a second degree polynomial to find trend
2. detrended = subtract trend from time series 
3. seasonal = group detrended by month and get mean

# convert non-stationary to stationary

1. first difference
1. second difference
1. take log or square root to remove non-constant variance
1. seasonal difference : y1(t) = y(t) - y(t-m)
