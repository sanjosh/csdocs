# description

matrix profile is a companion time series capturing local subsequence

at each point t, it captures euclidean distance to nearest neighbour (subsequence)

matrix profile index is another companion time series

compute all pairs of subsequences of length m, then you get matrix profile 

high values in profile indicate unique shape or anomaly (or discords)

low values in profile indicate motifs (regular patterns)

from motifs to time series chains
