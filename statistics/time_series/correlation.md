## pearson correlation  (global)

## local correlation

TLCC : time lagged cross correlation

WIndowed TLCC

## Dynamic time warping

can deal with signals of different lengths

but if there is missing data, that needs to be interpolated

## Instantaneous phase synchrony

extract phase information using Hilbert transform

# for imbalanced data

# multiple resolutions (time scales)

## Scale space methods

## DCCA Detrended Cross-correlation analysis

works for non-stationary signals
