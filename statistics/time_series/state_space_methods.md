Durbin & Koopman

observations are regarded as made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance terms, each of which is modelled separately. 

state space model has two principles
1. state process describes latent variable evolution : markov, 
2. observations are independent of states

produce estimator for y_t given data {y1,.., ys} 
1. When s < t, the problem is called forecasting or prediction. 
2. When s = t, the problem is called filtering, and 
3. when s > t, the problem is called smoothing.
