# stationary

```
A time series is stationary if the statistical properties of each time point in the series is constant.
the mean, the variance, and the dependence relationship of each point with previous points remains constant through the whole time series.
This is clearly a weaker assumption than independence, but still achieves a powerful and useful simplification.

There are three common properties or time series that we often stand in the way of stationarity.
These are trends, seasonality, and heteroscedasticity.

A trend is a change in the mean over time.
Heteroscedasticity corresponds to changing variance over time.
Seasonality refers to regular recurring effects in the time series.

# missing points : 

interpolation

# different scales

zero mean and unit amplitude (scaling and normalization)

# time lag :

# comparison : 

L2 is symmetric, L_inf

# time warping (stretch)
