three goals for inference from data
1. estimation of parameter values
2. prediction of data values
3. model comparison (since model params depend on hyperparameter, this is a case of parameter estimation)

Bayesian inference requires posterior distribution to be computed

Bayesian inference requires computing a difficult integral

Four different approaches
1. Use likelihood func with conjugate prior (simple math)
2. approx actual func with simpler ones 
3. Numerically approximate the integral
4. use MCMC methods  (this makes it practical)

HDI : Highest density interval (points within 95 perc range)

use HDI to convert to discrete decision - remove outliers

Effect size (diff of mean relative to standard dev) can also be computed

ROPE = region of practical equiv

Bayesian vs NHST

Bayesian Estimation Supersedes the t Test
