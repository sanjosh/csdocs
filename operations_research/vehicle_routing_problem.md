Modern Route Optimization with Python by Mauro Di Pietro
https://github.com/mdipietro09/DataScience_ArtificialIntelligence_Utils/blob/master/machine_learning/example_route_optimization.ipynb

## Variations

1. Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem: vehicles have a limited carrying capacity for the goods that must be delivered.
2. Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows: the delivery locations have time windows within the deliveries that must be made.
3. Vehicle Routing Problem with Pickup and Delivery: goods need to be moved from certain pickup locations to other delivery locations.
4. Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits: it is not mandatory for vehicles to visit all nodes, the aim is to maximize the sum of collected profits.

# libraries

1. Folium
2. OSMnx : queries Open Street Map and converts the response into NetworkX graphs
3. Plotly
4. ORTools
5. networkx
6. Mapbox : custom online maps

# ORTools

index manager  keeps track of the nodes indexing

routing model is the main OR-Tools object.
