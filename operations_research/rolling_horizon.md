large-scale instances with a long time horizon are usually solved using decomposition approaches

1. Lagrangian decomposition
2. Benders decomposition

## tail assignment problem

```
We investigate the cost optimal assignment of a set of heterogeneous aircraft to a
set of scheduled flights. The aircraft have to fulfill specific safety regulations and must be maintained
regularly. This problem is known as “integrated fleet and tail assignment problem with maintenance
constraints” in the literature, hereafter referred to as the “tail-assignment problem” (TAP).

## Rolling horizon survey

An extensive survey of the theory and application of the rolling-horizon approach can be found in
Chand et al. (2002). Example problems include inventory management as described in Morton (1978),
machine scheduling, for example in Ovacik and Uzsoy (1995), capacity expansion problems as in Ryan
(1998) and dynamic lot-sizing, see e.g. Sung and Lee (1993). Some authors have also applied the rolling
horizon approach to transportation problems, e.g. Nielsen et al. (2012).
