# questions

1. reorder point : at current demand, when will inventory go to zero
2. lead time : how much time to get new stock
3. ordering cost : is it linear or a step-function
4. loss to business or goodwill if item not found for sale

# principles
```
total cost = ordering cost + purchasing cost + holding cost (capital) + loss of goodwill if item not found by customer

difference between selling and buying

```

1. substitution : customer buys another item if this item not found
2. complementarity : customer buys some set of items together
3. basket buying behaviour :

# solution approach

assign cost to each and minimize derivative to find minima


# EOQ

# when to order

two cases

## lead time < EOQ 
               
## lead time > EOQ
