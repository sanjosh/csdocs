More than one objective function has to be minimized or maximized

There is no one solution but a set of solutions.

goodness of particular solution is determined by "dominance"

Pareto frontier and optimal solution

find solutions as close to Pareto optimal front

## scalarize/ Weighted sum method

combine objectives into single objective with user-supplied weight

There are three types of weights in scalarization which are equal weights, rank order centroid weights, and rank-sum weights.

Cannot find some Pareto-optimal solutions in case of non-convex objective space

## epsilon-constraint

Minimize one objective, while converting others to constraints

applies to convex and non-convex spaces

## weighted-metric

combine objectives using weighted distance metric of any solution from ideal solution z

## Genetic algorithms

it returns a set of solutions

there are several algorithms in this category

Kung's method, Strength Pareto EA
