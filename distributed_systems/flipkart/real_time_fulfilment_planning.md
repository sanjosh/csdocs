demand variability
1. dest mix
2. product mix 
3. seller mix 
4. service mix

supply variability
1. dependency on temp work force
2. transport capacity
3. network & infra issues
4. changing rules & regulations

Breach cost

BSP/Pregel/Giraph
1. vertex = time slots in facility
2. edge = movement from one slot in facility to another slot in another facility
3. input = requests received & forecast grouped by dim
4. messages  = allocation groups and learnings (bottlenecked dim & variable capacity requirement)
5. output = set of plans : dim group : time slot : number of shipments

simulated annealing

local plan : pick path optimization, sorting config, last mile vehicle routing problem
