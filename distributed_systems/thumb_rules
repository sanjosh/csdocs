CAP

PACELC
To me, CAP should really be PACELC --- 
if there is a partition (P) how does the system tradeoff between 
availability and consistency (A and C); 
else (E) when the system is running as normal in the absence of 
partitions, how does the system tradeoff between 
latency (L) and consistency (C)?
