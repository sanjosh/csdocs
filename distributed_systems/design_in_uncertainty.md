Problem | Solution

Everything is in flux | Organize based on Layers of Change
You have not been given a detailed BRD | Design in approximation
Some other team is not providing their API | Find a way to mock that vague third-party API
This case is going to be difficult to optimize | Nail down the end-to-end flow first
The allure of a perfect solution | Create a two-way door towards perfection 
Overwhelming choices of different platforms or libraries | Tailor your POC to your use-case
