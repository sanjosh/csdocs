1. dont overdo index
2. denormalize and materialized views
3. delete unnecessary data
4. vacuum full versus vacuum analyze
5. tune individual tables instead of db
6. understand the query planner


# postgres - 2

1. denormalize or materialized view
2. monthly partitions by timestamp
3. storing auto-increment IDs unnecessary


```
Since sharding by month progressively slows down bulk insert speeds as the month goes on, we use a temporary table to bulk insert the daily data and then use that throughout the next day for user-facing queries (a significant number of queries are for that data) and sync it to the actual table asynchronously.
```
and
```
 You can understand table health by querying pg_stat_user_tables. This tells you when a table was last vacuumed with which you can figure out if your vacuuming settings are optimal or not. You can also consider using the pg_stat_statements extension to record and analyze query usage metrics. It tells you the execution time of your queries, and how many times a particular table has been queried.
```

## common table expressions

```
CTEs (Common Table Expressions) can help compartmentalize and re-use sub-queries in a complex query. For large, complex queries, splitting them into CTEs and re-using them can help get better query plans and performance. Also, CTEs in a query run concurrently, so that can also big a plus. Weâ€™ve used CTEs heavily to optimize our queries.
