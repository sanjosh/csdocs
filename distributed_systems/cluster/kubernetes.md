# Networking in Kubernetes

* uses iptables
* Layer-3
* almost no portmapping
* CNI spec
* minikube for test cluster
* kubenet = linux network plugin created bridge called cbr0

CNI has 3 required functions : ADD, DEL and VERSION

# CNI 

overlay network

CNI plugins work on different OSI Network Layers to cover their use-cases. 

Many of them work on Layer 2, Layer 3 and Layer 4. 

If a CNI works on Layer 2, they are generally faster but donâ€™t have as many features as Layer 3 or Layer 4 based CNIs.

* within cluster, use netfilter linux or IPVS (IP virtual server)
