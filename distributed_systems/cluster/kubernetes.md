A cluster is formed from a combination of worker nodes and the control plane

# why

container orchestration - bringing it all together

1. scaling
2. customization
3. rolling updates and rollback
4. explicit control plane (API)
5. control plane state stored with interaction (objects and etcd)

# stateful applications

StatefulSets

StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.

Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

# control plane

The control plane is responsible for managing the clusters process, which includes kube-apiserver, etcd, Kubernetes scheduler, kube-controller-manager, and Cloud controller manager

1. An API server that transmits data both within the cluster and with external services
2. A scheduler that handles resource sharing among the nodes
3. A controller manager that watches the state of the nodes
4. A persistent data store to keep configurations
5. A controller manager and a cloud controller manager to manage control loops

# helm package manager

1. helm search
2. helm install
3. help create
4. help lint

# objects

two categories of objects in Kubernetes

basic objects: Pods, Service, Volumes, Namespace, etc., which are independent and donâ€™t require other objects

high-level objects (controllers): Deployments, Replication Controllers, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, Jobs, etc., which are built on top of the basic objects

## finalizer


# API

The Kubernetes API is what makes a cluster tick. Every action inside your Kubernetes cluster goes through the API. The entire kubectl tool is essentially a wrapper around this API. When you run kubectl apply, you are sending a request that tells the control plane to create your resources. This request goes through the API, which then hands it over to the right internal services.

client libraries to interact with API

https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/client-libraries/

operators to talk to API

## API groups

# operator

capture human knowledge; customization

# ConfigMap


# ingress

An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that allows traffic to come into your Kubernetes cluster.

Ingress provides externally available URLs, performs load balancing, terminates SSL/TLS, and offers name-based virtual hosting.

An Ingress controller is a daemon running in a Pod that watches the /ingresses endpoint on the API server. When a new endpoint is created, the daemon uses the configured set of rules to allow traffic into a service.
