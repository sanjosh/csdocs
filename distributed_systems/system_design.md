 The goal of the design process is not to generate a single point solution, but to instead characterize the design space for a given problem: 

 New designs should be described in terms of the design space

 Talk about the problem, not existing systems

 Practically, even if you are implementing only one app, it helps to always consider a second app (or even implement one in tests); to prevent application specifics from leaking into the abstraction.

  For each abstraction, build one implementation; plan for a second; hope for a third.
