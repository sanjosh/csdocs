# Problem of admission control for jobs with different deadlines

ensure total accepted jobs do not exceed capacity
1. Multiple clients sending jobs with different deadlines
2. On-demand variable load.  No available forecast of when next job is expected.

## Solution : keep a diary/calendar

keep "pending jobs" data structure sorted by time, containing available slots

this can be a circular queue/bitmap with length equal to "2 * max_deadline"

when you get new request with some deadline, walk back the "pending jobs" structure and reserve a slot

If a high priority client does not find an empty slot, it can overwrite the earliest booked slot which was assigned to a low priority client

As jobs are completed, mark the earliest slot you find as "free" (may not be current)

# Survey : statistical QoS effective bandwidth

five classes of admission control algorithms is reviewed by Knightly and Shroff [99]. 

1. scheduling based on average and peak rate information [100], 
2. effective bandwidth calculations [97,101,102], 
3. their refinements from large deviation principles [103], 
4. maximum variance approaches based on estimating the upper tails of Gaussian process models of traffic [95]
