# Functionality:

Apply abstraction
Reduce coordination
Embrace monotonicity

# Performance:

Prefer partial-order over total-order
Leverage time
Use indirection and proxies
Simulate for estimation

# Fault-tolerance/availability (does it keep working):

Ingrain fault-tolerance
Maintain a performance gradient
Invest in deterministic simulation
Feel the pain

# Bonus hint: Design for the cloud
