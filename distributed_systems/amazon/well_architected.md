AWS well-architected

Scale Factory

Three special Lenses : Serverless, IoT, High perf computing

OpEx, Security, Reliability, Perf efficiency, Cost optimisation

1. Security incident (forensic, pre-provision access, incident response plan, game day, quarantine)
2. Human access (credentials, privileges, lifecycle management, use roles or SSO)
3. Programmatic access (per component, dynamic auth)
4. Data classification (controls)

1. Storage options (metrics, access patterns)
2. Cost optimisation (workload review)
3. Disaster recovery (recovery objective, config drift, AZ failure)
4. Resilience test (playbook, RCA, fault injection, game day)
5. Workload (KPI, alerts, anomalies, changes)

4. deployment automation  (multiple env, 1-box, A/B, patch management)

## Metrics for software delivery performance

1. Time to restore service
1. Deployment frequency
1. time to deploy changes
1. failure rate of change
