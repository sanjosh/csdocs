# phenomenon at large scale

1. thundering herd : randomize, 
2. noisy neighbour : quotas
3. tail latency : 

# solutions

1. approximate over accurate
2. randomize
3. stateless over stateful (e.g. periodic disconnects to reconfigure, TTL)
4. live with partial result
5. cellular architecture and shuffle sharding
6. minimize modes; do constant work at all load levels
7. push versus pull
8. anomaly detection
