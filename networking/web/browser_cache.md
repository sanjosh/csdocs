The browser caches a file, stores a hash, the E-Tag, 
and checks with the server if the file has changed by sending the E-Tag

On the server side, there is a Redis map that maintains the E-Tags per user per resource. 

This tag is deleted when the cache becomes invalid, forcing a full HTTP 200 
response the next time thereâ€™s a request.
